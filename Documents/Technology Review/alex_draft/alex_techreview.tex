\section{UI Framework}
	\subsection{Overview}
		When writting an app or software that will be used by users of differing technical backgrounds much care must be placed into the UI.
		UI frameworks are tools that aid in the production of graphical user interfaces by bringing in functionalities and APIs from a wide range of sources.
		A goal of many of these frameworks is to abstract further away from the device platform and make cross-platform development easier.
		There exists many free UI frameworks all with differing backgrounds and utilizing different programming languages.
		I have chosen three of the most popular UI frameworks to examine for use in our project.

	\subsection{Options}
		\subsubsection{Xamarin}
			Xamarin is a UI framework built by Microsoft and integrated straight into Visual Studio.
			It is built on the C\# language commonly used in app development.
			Within Xamarin you are not limited to C\# however as you have full access to the Android API and you can call on existing Java code\cite{xamarin_platform}.
			Xamarin also comes with an advanced test framework.
			This framework allows you to create full automated test suites that tests your app as if a user was using it.
			You can create tests based on actual user gestures such as fingure taps and send the tests to be run on actual devices in the cloud\cite{xamarin_test}.

		\subsubsection{Corona SDK}
			Corona SDK is a UI framework that calls itself "The 2D Game Engine".
			It was created to be lightweight and fast performing framework.
			Corona utilizes the Lua language which also strives to be very lightweight as well as being well-rounded.
			However, you are not limited to Lua, Corona allows you to call on any native library such as Java and C++ or Swift for iOS development.
			There is no single Corona IDE but it can integrate with many popular IDEs and it has a simulator to let you test your code as you write it.
			Another useful testing tool is live testing which allows you to instantly send a new build of your app to devices on your local network\cite{corona_overview}.

		\subsubsection{Appcelerator}
			Appcelerator combination of many platforms and APIs all put together into one UI framework.
			Cross-platform development is a key feature of all UI frameworks but appcelerator makes it one of their main goals.
			To do this the framework is built on the Javascript language.
			Javascript is hated by many but its cross-platform capabilities make it nothing to scoff at and a good choice for Appcelerators goals.
			Appcelerators API Builder is a unique way to build APIs through a graphical user interface.
			The API Builder also comes with support for many different kinds of databases to easily include that data in your app\cite{appcelerator_overview}.

	\subsection{Comparison}
		Right off the bat Xamarin's testing capabilities is a huge advantage over the other frameworks.
		The ability to easily create automated test and have them run on a variety of actual hardware is invaluable.
		As far as programming language choice goes each language has its benefits and downsides depending on how it will be used.
		All of the frameworks support other languages anyways so there is a lot of flexibility here.
		When comparing cross-platform capabilities Appcelerator is a clear winner.
		That is not to say that the other two frameworks don't provide significant cross-platform capabilities.
		Corona is a winner in the performance department with Lua being so lightweight.
		All frameworks support a performance monitor to fine tune your apps.
		Appcelerator with its graphical UI seems to cater to a less technical audience and thus should be easier to use.
		On the other hand Javascript and be frustrating to use and one thing Corona and Lua like to boast about is how easy Lua is to learn.
		However, easy can sometimes be a burden to more experienced programmers who want more power or don't need a graphical UI to get stuff done.
		
	\subsection{Conclusion}
		Our app will be a relatively simple one.
		We don't need flashy graphics or to perform heavy calculations.
		With this in mind Corona's performance advantage is not as useful to us.
		We are only planning to develop the app for Android so cross-platform is not a huge concern to us.
		That being said the simplicity of our app means that a lot of what we write will be cross-platform anyways.
		When comparing languages Javascript leaves much to be desired when up agaisnt C\# and Lua.
		Since cross-platform capability is not a concern to use C\# or Lua stand out.
		Lastly, The test framework in Xamarin is far to good to ignore.
		Corona and Appcelerator both have simulation capabilities but being able to generate tests that behave as a user would save us a lot of time and resources.
		Because of the test framework and other comparisons we have decided to use Xamarin as our UI framework.

\section{Computing Device}
	\subsection{Overview}
		When picking a device to run your program on your have many things to consider.
		The system needs to be powerful enough to run your program.
		You need to consider what operating system works on the hardware or if you even need an operating system.
		Each piece of hardware is designed with different functions in mind.
		Since we will be doing imaging and machine learning in our project we need a device with lots of power.

	\subsection{Options}
		\subsubsection{Jetson TX2}
			NVIDIA calls its Jetson TX2 "an AI supercomputer on a module".
			The Jetson TX2 is designed to be a power house in a small box.
			The JetPack operating system designed for the Jetson and built from Linux comes installed on the Jetson\cite{jetson_dev_kit_guide}.
			It comes with a dedicated NVIDIA Pascal graphics card.
			The Jetson comes with a Quad ARM and a Dual Denver CPU.
			For memory the Jetson has 8 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM\cite{jetson_dev_kit}.

		\subsubsection{Raspberry Pi 3 Model B}
			The newest Raspberry Pi is designed to be accessible and easy to use.
			The NOOBS operating system was created to run on Pis but it does not come with the system.
			You must supply your own microSD card with either NOOBS or a different supported operating system installed.
			The Pi's processing power is a single quad core 1.2GHz CPU.
			For memory the Pi has 1 gigabyte of RAM\cite{raspberry_pi}.
