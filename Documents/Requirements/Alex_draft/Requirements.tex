\section{Description}
This project has 3 major components.
We need a phone/tablet app that can take pictures and send them to a Jetson TX2 processor.
On the Jetson processor will be an algorithm that can determine what seeds are in the picture and quality of the seeds.
The output of the algorithm will need to be saved in a database and sent to the user who sent the picture.

The app for phone/tablet will be an android(?) app developed in Java.
The app will need to be able to access the phones cameras and take pictures or pull from the users pictures.
Will we need rig to help take better pictures?
Will there need to be a rig to place the seeds in?
The app will then connect remotely to our Jetson processor and send the image.
Does the app need to be able to recieve processed image data or just send to users email?

Algorithm will use machine learning to decide what is in the images.
which learning algorithm will we use?
Coded in C++?
Can we deliver 500 seeds over 5 images?
Stretch goal 2,500 seeds in one image.
What is a reasonable time to process the images in?

Output will be in a pdf.
