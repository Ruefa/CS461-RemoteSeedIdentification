\section{UI Framework}
	\subsection{Overview}
		When writting an app or software that will be used by users of differing technical backgrounds much care must be placed into the UI.
		UI frameworks are tools that aid in the production of graphical user interfaces by bringing in functionalities and APIs from a wide range of sources.
		There exists many free UI frameworks all with differing backgrounds and utilizing different programming languages.
		I have chosen three of the most popular UI frameworks to examine for use in our project.

	\subsection{Options}
		\subsubsection{Xamarin}
			Xamarin is a UI framework built by Microsoft and integrated straight into Visual Studio.
			It is built on the C# language commonly used in app development.
			Within Xamarin you are not limited to C# however as you have full access to the Android API and you can call on existing Java code.
			Xamarin also comes with an advanced test framework.
			This framework allows you to create full automated test suites that tests your app as if a user was using it.
			You can create tests based on actual user gestures such as fingure taps and send the tests to be run on actual devices in the cloud.

		\subsubsection{Corona SDK}


		\subsubsection{Appcelerator}
